# 👋 Hey, I’m Lakshay Arora

### 🚀 Aerospace PhD | 🤖 AI/ML Engineer | ☁️ Cloud-Native Builder

Welcome to my GitHub — where machine learning meets orbital mechanics, and theory becomes toolkits. I'm currently pursuing a PhD in **Aerospace Engineering** at Carleton University, developing intelligent guidance and control strategies for spacecraft using a fusion of AI and control theory.

## 🧠 What I Do

- 🛰 **Autonomous Systems & Spacecraft GNC**  
  Developing uncertainty-aware path planning and docking algorithms using Koopman theory, optimization, and simulation-based control.

- 🤖 **Applied Machine Learning & Generative AI**  
  Designing data-driven systems for forecasting, classification, and autonomous decision-making in aerospace, fintech, and education.

- ☁️ **Scalable AI on the Cloud**  
  Building and deploying ML pipelines using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** — Vertex AI, BigQuery, Cloud Functions, and more.

- 📚 **Research to Reality**  
  I publish, present, prototype — and turn ideas into tools that actually work.
